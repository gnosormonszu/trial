## Step 2: Create a Terrain in SketchUp 2019

For this example, we will use the Sandbox tools to create a simple terrain. Go to Tools > Sandbox > From Scratch and draw a rectangular grid on the ground plane.

## Step 3: Scatter Objects on Your Terrain Using Skatter v1.4.7 Plugin for SketchUp 2019
 
Now comes the fun part: scattering objects on your terrain using Skatter v1.4.7 plugin for SketchUp 2019. To do this, you need to select your terrain as the host surface and choose the objects you want to scatter as the scattered entities.
 
To select your terrain as the host surface, click on the Skatter icon on the toolbar or go to Extensions > Skatter > Open Skatter Library Window. In the Skatter Library window, click on the Hosts tab and then click on the Pick button. Then click on your terrain in SketchUp 2019 to select it as the host surface.
 
To choose the objects you want to scatter as the scattered entities, you can either use the built-in library of objects that comes with Skatter or import your own models from SketchUp 2019 or other sources.
 
To use the built-in library of objects, click on the Library tab in the Skatter Library window and browse through the categories of objects available. You can find objects such as grass, trees, rocks, flowers, and more. To add an object to your scene, simply drag and drop it from the library onto your host surface in SketchUp 2019.
 
To import your own models from SketchUp 2019 or other sources, you need to save them as components or groups in SketchUp 2019 first. Then go to Extensions > Skatter > Import Models and browse to the location where you saved your models. Select them and click on Open.
