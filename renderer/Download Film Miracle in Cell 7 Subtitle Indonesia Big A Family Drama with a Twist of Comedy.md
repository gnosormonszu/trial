Miracle in Cell No. 7 is based on a true story of a father and daughter who were separated by a wrongful conviction. The father, Lee Yong-gu, is a mentally challenged man who works as a parking attendant and loves his daughter, Ye-seung, more than anything. One day, he is accused of kidnapping and killing the daughter of a high-ranking police officer. He is sentenced to death and sent to cell no. 7, where he meets six other inmates who initially bully him but later become his friends and family.
 
The inmates devise a plan to smuggle Ye-seung into the prison by disguising her as the warden's granddaughter. They take turns looking after her and teaching her various skills. Ye-seung also helps her father prove his innocence by finding clues and witnesses. However, their secret is eventually discovered by the authorities, and they face a dangerous situation that threatens their lives.
 
The film is a heartwarming and tear-jerking story that explores the themes of love, friendship, justice, and family.

The film received critical acclaim and won several awards, such as the Grand Bell Award for Best Film and the Blue Dragon Film Award for Best Actor.
