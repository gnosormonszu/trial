# What's New in CATIA V5-6R2013?
 
CATIA V5-6R2013 is the latest release of the 3D CAD software from Dassault SystÃ¨mes. It offers improved user productivity and usability, as well as compatibility and synchronization with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. In this article, we will highlight some of the new features and enhancements that CATIA V5-6R2013 brings to its users.
 
## Part Design
 
One of the most important workbenches in CATIA V5 is Part Design, which allows users to create solid models of parts using sketch-based and feature-based methods. In CATIA V5-6R2013, Part Design has been enriched with several new capabilities, such as:

- The ability to create **multi-sections solids** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **multi-sections surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **offset surfaces** with variable thickness along a direction or a reference surface, allowing more flexibility in creating thin-walled parts.
- The ability to create **lofted surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **sweep surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **blend surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **extruded surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **revolved surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **spherical surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **cylindrical surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **tapered surfaces** with up to four guide curves and two section profiles, allowing more complex shapes to be modeled easily.
- The ability to create **fillets** with variable radius along a direction or a reference surface, allowing more flexibility in creating smooth transitions between faces.
- The ability to create **chamfers** with variable angle or distance along a direction or a reference surface, allowing more flexibility in creating sharp transitions between faces.
- The ability to create **drafts** with variable angle or distance along a direction or a reference surface, allowing more flexibility in creating tapered faces for molding purposes.
- The ability to create **shells** with variable thickness along a direction or a reference surface, allowing more flexibility in creating hollow parts.
- The ability to create **pockets**, **pads**, **shafts**, **grooves**, **ribs**, **slots**, **screws**, **bolt circles**, **taps**, and **dies** using sketch-based or feature-based methods, allowing more options in creating common features for mechanical parts.
- The ability to use the **Edit Sketch Definition command**, which allows users to modify the sketch that defines a feature without exiting the Part Design workbench.
- The ability to use the **Edit Feature Definition command**, which allows users 8cf37b1e13
