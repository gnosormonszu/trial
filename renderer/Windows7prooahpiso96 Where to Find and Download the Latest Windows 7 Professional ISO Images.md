Windows 7 Professional is one of the editions of Windows 7, a popular operating system developed by Microsoft. Windows 7 Professional is designed for business and advanced users who need features such as domain join, network backup, location-aware printing, offline files, and Remote Desktop. Windows 7 Professional also supports up to 192 GB of RAM and two physical processors.
 
Windows 7 Professional was released in October 2009 and received positive reviews from critics and users. It was praised for its improved performance, stability, security, and user interface. However, Windows 7 Professional also had some drawbacks, such as compatibility issues with some older hardware and software, lack of native support for USB 3.0 and Bluetooth 4.0, and limited customization options.
 
Windows 7 Professional is no longer supported by Microsoft since January 2020, which means that it does not receive any security updates or technical assistance. This makes it vulnerable to malware and cyberattacks and may cause compatibility problems with newer devices and applications. Therefore, it is recommended that you upgrade to Windows 10, the latest version of Windows, which offers better performance, security, features, and support.
