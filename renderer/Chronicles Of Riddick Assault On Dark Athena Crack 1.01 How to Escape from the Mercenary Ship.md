Fortunately, there is a way to play the game without any online activation or installation limits, thanks to a crack released by Reloaded group in 2010. The crack is based on the GOG version of the game, which includes both Escape from Butcher Bay and Assault on Dark Athena, as well as some bonus content such as wallpapers, soundtrack, and manual[^1^]. The crack also updates the game to version 1.01, which fixes some bugs and improves performance[^3^]. Here are the steps to install and play the game with crack 1.01:
 
1. Download the game from any torrent site or use the link provided by DODI Repacks[^1^]. The repack size is 5.3 GB and the final size is 11 GB.
2. Unrar the game using WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Install the game by running setup.exe.
4. Install the update located in the /Crack dir on the DVD.
5. Copy over the cracked content located in the /Crack dir on the DVD to your <install>SystemWin32_x86 dir.</install>
6. Play the game by running Riddick.exe.

Enjoy playing The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena with crack 1.01!
  
The game features two main modes: Escape from Butcher Bay and Assault on Dark Athena. Escape from Butcher Bay is a remake of the original game, with enhanced graphics, voice acting, and gameplay. It follows Riddick's escape from a maximum security prison, where he encounters various enemies, allies, and challenges. Assault on Dark Athena is a new campaign that takes place after Escape from Butcher Bay. It follows Riddick's struggle to survive on the Dark Athena, a mercenary ship that captures and enslaves prisoners. It introduces new enemies, weapons, and environments, as well as a multiplayer mode.
 
The game is mainly a first-person shooter, with some elements of stealth, hand-to-hand combat, and puzzle-solving. Riddick can use various firearms and melee weapons, as well as his trademark ulaks (curved blades) and eyeshine (night vision). He can also hide in shadows, sneak behind enemies, and perform stealth kills. The game features a health system that regenerates over time, as well as a checkpoint system that saves the player's progress. The game also has some role-playing elements, such as dialogue choices, side quests, and character upgrades.
 
The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its atmosphere, story, voice acting, and gameplay. However, some critics also noted its technical issues, linear level design, and lackluster multiplayer mode. The game was nominated for several awards, such as Best Action Game and Best Voice Acting at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards.
 
If you are looking for some tips to play the game better, here are some suggestions:

- Use stealth whenever possible. Riddick is more effective when he is hidden and silent. Avoid direct confrontation with enemies unless necessary. Use shadows, vents, and cover to move around undetected. Use stealth kills to take out enemies quietly and save ammo.
- Explore your surroundings. The game has many hidden items and secrets that can help you in your journey. Look for ammo, health packs, nanomed cartridges (which increase your health capacity), bounty cards (which unlock bonus content), and cigarette packs (which unlock developer commentary). You can also find useful information and clues from terminals, logs, and NPCs.
- Use your eyeshine wisely. Riddick's eyeshine allows him to see in the dark, which gives him an advantage over his enemies. However, it also makes him more vulnerable to bright lights, which can blind him temporarily. Use your eyeshine only when you need it, and turn it off when you are in well-lit areas.
- Choose your weapons carefully. Riddick can carry up to three weapons at a time: one firearm, one melee weapon, and one special weapon (such as grenades or mines). Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation. For example, shotguns are powerful at close range but ineffective at long range; rifles are accurate at long range but slow to reload; ulaks are silent but require close contact; etc. Experiment with different weapons and find the ones that suit your playstyle.
- Have fun! The game is not too hard or too easy; it offers a fair challenge for most players. Don't be afraid to try different strategies and tactics; there is more than one way to complete each mission. Enjoy the story, the characters, and the action; immerse yourself in the world of Riddick.
