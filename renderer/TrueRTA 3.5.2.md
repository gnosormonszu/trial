## What is TrueRTA 3.5.2?
 
TrueRTA 3.5.2 is a real-time audio spectrum analyzer that runs on Windows computers. It uses a sound card as an input and output device, and displays the frequency spectrum of the audio signal on a graphical interface. You can adjust the resolution, range, and scale of the spectrum, as well as apply various filters and functions to analyze the audio characteristics.
 
TrueRTA 3.5.2 can measure the frequency response, harmonic distortion, noise level, phase shift, impulse response, and other parameters of any audio device or system. You can use it to test speakers, microphones, amplifiers, equalizers, mixers, sound cards, headphones, and more. You can also use it to calibrate your audio equipment, tune your room acoustics, or design your own audio filters and crossovers.
