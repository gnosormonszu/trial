The film follows Rebecca (Palmer) and Martin (Bateman), who have moved on with their lives after the death of their mother Sophie (Bello) and the defeat of her malevolent alter ego Diana (Botet). However, they soon discover that Diana is not gone for good, and that she has a connection to another family that is haunted by her presence. As Diana's power grows stronger, Rebecca and Martin must team up with their estranged father Paul (Burke) and a mysterious woman named Rachel (Chastain) to stop her once and for all.
 
Lights Out 2 was released on October 31, 2022 by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances, atmosphere, and scares, but criticized the plot, characters, and reliance on jump scares. The film was a box office success, grossing $220 million worldwide against a budget of $35 million.
  
The film begins with a flashback to 1996, where a young Rachel (SkarsgÃ¥rd) is living with her abusive father Charles (Patrick Wilson) and her mentally ill mother Alice (Amy Adams) in a remote farmhouse. One night, Alice tells Rachel that she has a friend named Diana who lives in the dark and protects her from Charles. Rachel is skeptical, but soon witnesses Diana's terrifying appearance and abilities. Diana kills Charles and tries to kill Rachel, but Alice sacrifices herself to save her daughter. Rachel escapes and is taken to a foster home.
 
In the present day, Rachel is a successful journalist who has moved to Los Angeles with her husband Mark (Chris Hemsworth) and their son Danny (Finn Wolfhard). She has suppressed the memories of her childhood trauma and believes that Diana was a figment of her mother's imagination. However, she starts to experience strange phenomena in her new house, such as flickering lights, moving shadows, and eerie noises. She also receives a phone call from a woman named Rebecca, who claims to know about Diana and warns her that she is in danger.
 
Rebecca is Martin's older sister, who has been investigating Diana's origins and history. She has learned that Diana was a patient at a psychiatric hospital where Alice and Sophie were also treated. Diana suffered from a rare skin condition that made her sensitive to light and caused her to emit electromagnetic pulses that interfered with electrical devices. She was experimented on by a doctor named Dr. Morris (Anthony Hopkins), who tried to cure her by exposing her to intense light. However, this only made her condition worse and turned her into a vengeful spirit that could manipulate darkness.
 
Rebecca tells Rachel that Diana has attached herself to their mothers' bloodline and that she can only be destroyed by destroying the source of her power: the hospital where she died. Rebecca also reveals that she has been in contact with Paul, who has agreed to help them. Rachel is reluctant to believe Rebecca, but agrees to meet her at the hospital after Mark and Danny are attacked by Diana at their home.

At the hospital, Rebecca, Martin, Paul, and Rachel find Dr. Morris's office, where they discover his recordings and notes on Diana. They also find a hidden basement where Diana's body is kept in a sealed chamber. They decide to open the chamber and expose Diana's body to sunlight, hoping that this will end her curse. However, they are confronted by Diana, who has followed them and killed Dr. Morris. A violent showdown ensues, during which Paul sacrifices himself to distract Diana while Rebecca and Martin manage to open the chamber. The sunlight burns Diana's body and causes her to scream in agony.
 
Rachel then realizes that she has a psychic link with Diana, as they both share Alice's DNA. She uses this link to communicate with Diana and convince her to let go of her anger and hatred. She tells Diana that she forgives her for killing her parents and that she understands her pain. She also tells Diana that she loves her as a sister and that she wants her to be free. Diana is touched by Rachel's words and decides to stop fighting. She thanks Rachel for giving her peace and disappears into the light.
 
The film ends with Rachel, Rebecca, Martin, Mark, and Danny leaving the hospital together as a new family. They look up at the sky and see a bright star shining among the clouds, implying that Diana has found her place in heaven.
