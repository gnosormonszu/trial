## Summary of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce
 
The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce is a novel that follows the journey of Harold Fry, a 65-year-old retired salesman who lives in a small English village with his wife Maureen. One day, he receives a letter from Queenie Hennessy, a former colleague and friend whom he has not seen or heard from in 20 years. Queenie informs him that she is dying of cancer and is writing to say goodbye.
 
Harold writes a brief and awkward reply and sets off to post it, but on his way he has a change of heart. He decides to walk all the way from his home in Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed, where Queenie is staying. He believes that as long as he walks, Queenie will live. He leaves behind his wife, who is frustrated and confused by his sudden departure, and embarks on his unlikely pilgrimage.
 
Along the way, Harold meets various people who share their stories and problems with him. He also reflects on his own life, his marriage, his son, his regrets and his losses. He remembers how he met Queenie at the brewery where they both worked, and how she helped him in a difficult situation that he never told anyone about. He realizes that he has a lot to thank her for, and also to apologize for.
