In addition to his role in the Croatian War of Independence, Bobetko also had a long and distinguished career as a partisan fighter and a military officer in the former Yugoslavia. He was one of the founding members of 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, the first anti-fascist military unit during World War II in Yugoslavia. He fought against the Nazi occupation and the UstaÅ¡e regime, and participated in many battles and campaigns across Yugoslavia and abroad.
  
After the war, he continued his military service in the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), rising to the rank of general. He held various commands and positions, such as the commander of the 5th Army District in Zagreb, the deputy chief of staff of JNA, and the head of the Military Academy. He was also involved in some international missions, such as the Non-Aligned Movement observer in Vietnam and Cambodia. He retired from JNA in 1972, after he was accused of being a Croatian nationalist by the communist authorities.
  
He returned to public life in 1990, when he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and supported Franjo TuÄman's vision of an independent Croatia. He became one of the key figures in the formation and development of the Croatian Army (HV), and was appointed as its chief of staff in 1992. He led HV through some of the most decisive and successful operations against the Serb rebels and the JNA, such as Operation Storm, which liberated most of the occupied Croatian territory in 1995.
  
He retired from HV in 1995, but remained active in politics and public affairs. He was elected as a member of parliament for HDZ in 2000, and was also nominated as a presidential candidate by some war veterans' associations. However, he withdrew from the race due to his poor health. In 2001, he was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for alleged war crimes committed during Operation Medak Pocket in 1993. He refused to cooperate with ICTY and denied any wrongdoing. He died in 2003 at his home in Zagreb.
